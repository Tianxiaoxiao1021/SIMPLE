# SIMPLE
## About
SIMPLE is an open-source, non-commercial codebase designed to provide beginners or individual developers with an easy, lightweight way to develop without having to configure complex external libraries.
## Config
Download or clone one of SIMPLE's modules locally, add the module to an additional include directory in your IDE, and subsequently include or introduce the module into your project and code.
Is as *SIMPLE* as its name suggests!
### Tip
As mentioned earlier, SIMPLE is not focused on being efficient and fast, but that doesn't mean we don't optimize and iterate on our code architecture. If you need a library that is most efficient, fast and powerful, then I'm sorry to say that SIMPLE is not the best choice for you.
## SIMPLE-UI
SIMPLE-UI is one of the child module of SIMPLE, is a graphical user interface (GUI) framework, rendered using OpenGL & GLFW
